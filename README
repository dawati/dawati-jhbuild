Dawati - JHBuild
===============================================================================

jhbuid-dawati is a repository containing scripts and a JHBuild moduleset for
building and developing the Dawati Shell User Shell and related libraries.

Initialization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install the following dependencies (on Debian) :

  bison flex libdbus-glib-1-dev libgdu-dev libgudev-1.0-dev libicu-dev

You should check out JHBuild from the GNOME Git repository:

  git clone git://git.gnome.org/jhbuild

Then build it and install it.

Then, from within your jhbuild-dawati clone run:

  make install

This command will install:

  - $HOME/bin/jhbuild-dawati       - a wrapper around jhbuild
  - $HOME/.jhbuildrc-dawati        - a jhbuild configuration file
  - $HOME/.jhbuildrc-dawati-custom - a jhbuild configuration file for
                                  customisations of the default settings

Building Dawati Shell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the whole Dawati Shell UI:

  jhbuild-dawati build

This will also take care of the dependencies.

The modules will be downloaded under $HOME/dawati/source.
The modules will be installed under $HOME/dawati/install

Running Dawati Shell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start a jhbuild shell:

  mutter --replace --mutter-plugins=dawati-netbook

Common issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Why jhbuild can't find the Dawati Shell modules file?
A: The default modules file is expected to be at:

  ~/src/jhbuild-dawati/build/dawati.modules

If you've installed jhbuild-dawati to a different location,
edit the jhbuildrc-dawati-custom configuration file, uncommenting and
editing the

  moduleset

line. Using the absolute path to the dawati.modules file should work.

Q: Why doesn't <insert a D-Bus service> start?
A: In order to activate a D-Bus service installed within the JHBuild
root you have to modify the /etc/dbus-1/session.conf file by adding
the following line:

  <servicedir>@PREFIX@/dawati/install/share/dbus-1/services</servicedir>

Where @PREFIX@ is the prefix used by JHBuild -- the user's home directory
by default.

You will have to restart D-Bus, which usually means logging out or a
complete reboot.
